# Dalhousie Hackathon 2019
A ShiftKey Labs Hackathon hosted and in partner with Dalhousie University, which ran from November 25th to November 27th, 2019. The hackathon was open to all participants across Nova Scotia and was about solving a chosen challenge over the course of 48 hours, and then presenting that solution on the final day. 

## Challenge & Proposed Solution
Pedestrian and driver safety around the world is becoming more and more of a problem as more distractions
become available at our fingertips. Apps like Snapchat, Discord, and Slack have a tremdendous amount of users, however these apps have no voice integrations for assitants like Siri, which are limited to native apps only. 

Drivers stubbornly continue to use their phones despite the increase in risk to cause an accident. Avon seeks to eliminate this increased risk caused by the use of third party apps by adding voice integrations & passive commands such as alerts when a speeding threshold is breached when driving in certain areas.
